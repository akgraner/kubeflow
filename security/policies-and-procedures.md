# Policies and Procedures

Currently the team is working to finalize this work and have it completed for the 1.8 Release and for the transition to the CNCF.
These policies and procedures will be based of the [Kubernetes Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/)
We are working on updating and editing these policies and procedures for the Kubeflow Community.  Our very **rough DRAFT and working docs** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjWa0G2UqdsP1QROYVEl9iQR6v1x8HD7-F4TQo7lV6M/edit?usp=sharing).

Kubeflow Security Team [Policy and Procedure Working Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vw_efQyYG_zWEoL-vk9mZQX5p7fOcl3RTG6pcxMhYKI/edit?usp=sharing) - Please note this is only a **WORKING** Document. 

## This is the second iteration of the Kubeflow Security Policy and Procedures are as follows*:

*Please note we will continue to iterate on this with each release and as we get commitments from our distributions and volunteers from each of the Kubeflow components and working groups (WG). As the team grows we will work to set up roles and responsibilities to bring us closer in line with the Kubernetes policies and procedures.* 


The Kubeflow Security team (listed below as “we”) will take a multi-level, transparent approach to the security of Kubeflow (product/code). At this time we will base this effort to align with each release.  As noted above as we get more volunteers to help with these efforts we will continue to iterate on the cadence 

1. We will encourage Kubeflow users to send an email to security@kubeflow.org to report a security issue or vulnerability.  Please use the following template format to email a security report to the Kubeflow Security Team. 

   Emails should contain:
     * description of the problem
     * precise and detailed steps (include screenshots) that created the problem
     * the affected version(s)
     * any possible mitigations, if known
     
       * You will receive a reply from one of the a Kubeflow Security Team member acknowledging receipt of the email.

       * You may be contacted by a Kubeflow Security Team member to further discuss the reported item. Please bear with us as we seek to understand the breadth and scope of the reported problem, recreate it, and confirm if there is a vulnerability present.

2. We will work with the WG leads to give updates on any security related issues that are sent to the Security Team.

3. We will go through all reports sent to the security email on a bi-weekly basis. 

4. We use the results from the 1.7 Release scans (and later in the 1.8 Release when we have those scans) and work to break these out into their respective WGs and reach out those leads (as noted in #2 above)


*The next Security Team meeting will be on **24 May 2023** and we will update the above as changes are approved.*
